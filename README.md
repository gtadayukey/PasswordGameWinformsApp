# Password Game with C#
Welcome to the Password Game, a fun and interactive project developed using C#, .NET, and WinForms. This README will guide you through the game, its features, and how to download and play it.
Also, this project is part of a **College Project** that required the implementation of regular expressions in any way desired.
I decided that i would make a simple password game inspired in the famous "The Password Game" from NealFun that you can check [here](https://neal.fun/password-game/).

## Overview
The Password Game is designed to challenge players to create passwords that meet specific constraints. 
These constraints range from including at least one special character to incorporating dynamic elements such as the current date or conditions like leap years.

## Features
- Constraint-based Password Creation: Players must adhere to various constraints while crafting their passwords, making it both challenging and educational.
- Dynamic Constraints: Constraints such as incorporating the current date or ensuring the password contains special characters add depth and variety to the gameplay.
- WinForms Interface: The game features an intuitive user interface built using WinForms, providing a seamless and engaging experience for players of all levels.
- Feedback Mechanism: Instant feedback is provided to the player regarding the validity of their password, towards a progress bar.
